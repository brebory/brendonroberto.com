			<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
			<p class="body-copy">I&rsquo;m a full-stack developer with experience in web, mobile and games, who loves <strong>good design</strong>, <strong>good code</strong>, and <strong>good people</strong>. I work as a Staff Developer for <a href="https://hyland.com">Hyland</a> and I also work as a freelance contractor for hire on web applications and mobile games.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I&rsquo;m excited to live and work in a time when there are huge advances in technology every year. Thanks to frameworks like .NET, Angular, and React, and the accessibility of the cloud, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to share and collaborate on building awesome products with people from all corners of the planet.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I&rsquo;m always stoked to give back to the community by helping out with <a href="https://www.hyland.com/en/explore/hy-tech/tech-outreach-overview/club">Hy-Tech Club</a>.</p>

			<h1 class="heading">Where I&rsquo;m From</h1>
			<p class="body-copy">I&rsquo;m from the Midwest - Ohio, specifically - Cleveland, even more specifically. I love my rust belt city - I&rsquo;m 10 minutes from downtown in one direction, and 10 minutes from the Metroparks in the other.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Visual Communication Design from Kent State University, with a focus in <strong>interaction design</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>. I thrive when I can strike the perfect balance between my creative mind and my analytical mind.</p>

			<h1 class="heading">More About Me</h1>
			<dl class="questions">
				<dt>What are your favorite hobbies?</dt>
				<dd>I&rsquo;m a huge gamer. I also <strong>LOVE</strong> food, both eating and cooking. I&rsquo;m always trying out new recipies and expanding my palate. Foodies unite!</dd>
				<dt>What&rsquo;s your dream job?</dt>
				<dd>I&rsquo;d love to open my own game studio in the future!</dd>
				<dt>What&rsquo;s your background?</dt>
				<dd>I&rsquo;ve been programming since I was in middle school. I first learned to program on the TI-84 Plus calculator, in TI-BASIC, during math class. From there, I learned C++, followed by Bash, then JavaScript, and a multitude of other languages - C#, Lua, Swift, Java, Rust, and TypeScript included. Because I&rsquo;ve always been confident in my programming abilities, I decided to go to school for design to shore up my eye for aesthetics and broaden my skills.</dd>
