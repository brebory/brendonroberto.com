			<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
			<p class="body-copy">I&rsquo;m a full-stack developer with experience in web, mobile and games, who loves <strong>good design</strong>, <strong>good food</strong>, and <strong>good people</strong>. I work as a Staff Developer for <a href="https://hyland.com">Hyland</a> and I also work as a freelance contractor for hire on web applications and mobile games.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I&rsquo;m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in technology. Thanks to frameworks like .NET, Angular, and React, and the accessibility of the cloud, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to share and collaborate on building awesome products with others from all corners of the planet, all because of the Internet.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I&rsquo;m always stoked to give back to the community by helping out with <a href="https://www.hyland.com/en/explore/hy-tech/tech-outreach-overview/club">Hy-Tech Club</a>.</p>

			<p class="body-copy">I&rsquo;m from the Midwest - Ohio, specifically - Cleveland, even more specifically. I love the spacious fields, the smell of the outdoors, and the people in Ohio. I bring a bit of the Midwest work ethic to all my projects - a craftsman&rsquo;s approach to <strong>Doing Things Right the First Time</strong>.</p>
			<p class="body-copy">I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Visual Communication Design from Kent State University, with a focus in <strong>interaction design</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>.</p>
